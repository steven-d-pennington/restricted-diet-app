## Core Problem Statement

### The Problem We're Solving

**Primary Problem**: People with dietary restrictions face daily anxiety and safety risks due to inadequate information about food ingredients and restaurant safety practices, leading to:
- 3.4 million emergency room visits annually from food allergic reactions
- Significant time waste (2-4 hours weekly) researching safe food options
- Social isolation from fear of dining out
- $33 billion annual healthcare costs from food allergy complications

**Why Existing Solutions Fail**:
1. **Fragmented Information**: Users must check multiple apps, websites, and sources
2. **Accuracy Issues**: 90% of food allergy data is based on unreliable self-reporting
3. **Limited Restaurant Coverage**: Most solutions focus only on chain restaurants
4. **Poor User Experience**: Complex interfaces that don't work under pressure
5. **No Community Verification**: No way to verify information accuracy

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue is the information asymmetry between food providers (restaurants, manufacturers) and consumers with dietary restrictions, compounded by the life-threatening consequences of incorrect information.

## Product Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement
To create a world where dietary restrictions never limit someone's food choices or social experiences.

### Mission Statement
We empower people with dietary restrictions to make confident, safe food decisions through accurate, community-verified information and personalized guidance.

### Product Principles
1. **Safety First**: All features prioritize user safety over convenience
2. **Community-Driven**: Users contribute and verify information for collective benefit
3. **Transparency**: Clear data sources and confidence levels for all information
4. **Personalization**: Tailored experiences based on individual restriction profiles
5. **Continuous Learning**: Platform improves through user feedback and usage patterns
